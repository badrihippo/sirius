# Website for the Sirius Magazine
This repository contains the django project files for the [Sirius Magazine website](http://sirius.sssnet.tk/), but it may also be useful for other, similar websites.

In addition to displaying published articles, the website also keeps track of:
 * Issues of the magazine, and which article was published in which issue
 * [Squiggles](http://sirius.sssnet.tk/squiggle/about/), which are like Google's Doodles, and appear on the cover of the issue covering that event
 * Sources, Copyrights and Credits for photos and pictures

I've made this repository mainly for myself to work on, but feel free to improve it if you want!
